# Final-Year-Project
Source Code for my Final Year Project which is Titled as Density Based Traffic Control System..

The system is designed in python and it uses image processing via yolov3 to identify and count the number of cars in images.
Yolov3 was trained on the MSCOCO Dataset.

The system first detects cars in an image and counts them. After which,the time to be alloted to a particular lane is calculated based on the number of cars present.

Credits to [insert crisis here] as well as WeziMk for their help during the development of this project..
