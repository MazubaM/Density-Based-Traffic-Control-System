# Final-Year-Project
Source Code for my Final Year Project which is Titled as Density Based Traffic Control System..

code requires clean up as duplicate blocks of functions are there... 
The jupyter notebook provided has the required package versions of the packages required..

The system uses image processing via yolov3 to identify and count the number of cars in images
it then uses that number of cars to determine the time to be alloted to a particular lane.
